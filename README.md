Set DNS addresses
-----------------

I got sick of trying to cope with Apple's ever changing interface names for Ethernet and other network interfaces. For example I know of the following for Ethernet:

Ethernet

Ethernet 1

Ethernet 2

USB Ethernet

Thunderbolt Ethernet

and so on.

So I wrote a script that was configurable and would do a lot of the hard work for you. Simply specify an interface name such as "Ethernet", the DNS and Search Domain addresses and the script will hunt round for any interface that has "Ethernet" in the name and apply the settings.

Parameter 4: Network Service Name

Parameter 5: Search Domain 1

Parameter 6: Search Domain 2

Parameter 7: DNS Address 1

Parameter 8: DNS Address 2
